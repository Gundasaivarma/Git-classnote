Git Merge vs Git Rebase
==============================
In Git there are 2 ways to integrate changes from one branch to another 
=>git merge
=>git rebase

git merge
-------------
is a non-destructive operation
existing branches are not changed in any way
creates a new merge commit in the feature branch

git rebase
==========
moves the entire feature branch to begin on the tip of the master branch
re-write the project history
we get much cleaner and liner project history

================
what is Git stash and when should developer use git stash
------------------
Gut has an area called the stash where you can temporarily store a snapshot of your 
changes without committing them to the repository.its separate from the working dir
the staging area or the repository
-----
This functionality is useful when you have made chnages to a branch that you are not ready to commit
but you need to switch to another branch

=>modified a file
=>git stash =>it will go to the temp location
=>git status
=>git stash pop=>again come back from temp to workstation
