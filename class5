branch
merge
rebase
==================
Branch
-------------------
=>devloper are create verious functionality for that we need to create branch
master
feature branch
-------
step to create a branch
===========================
git branch
git branch branchname
git branch
git checkout branchname
git checkout -b branchname

-------------
delete 
============
git branch -d branch (u should come out from the branch and delete)
=============================
merge
==============================

step1:create branch and add some new thing
step2:come to master and try to merge
        --1st need to identfiy where need to merge
		--see which one source and which one destination
		--go to destination and do merge
-----------------------
=>master
=>create branch called child 
=>add some file in child 
=>go to master 
=>git merge source destination
=>git merge child master
=====================
merge conflit
========================
=>In master added some new file called jenkins
=>go to child branch and add samefile jenkins
=>come to master try to merge 
=>conflit will happened
=>manulay need to open the file and slove the issue 
=>add and commit the file 
=>check the commit id 
==========================
rebase
=========================
when we are doing merging 
master=>A=B
child=>A=B
---------
STEP2:
------
master=>A=B=C=D(in master branch u made some commit)
child=>A=B
STEP3:switch to child branch and add some commit
-----
master=>A=B=C=D
child=>A=B=E=F(in child branch u made some commit)

STEP4:SOURCE IS MASTER AND DESTINATION IS CHILD
     --merge from master to child 
	    A=B=E=F=C=D
		it is working nonlinier work flow
NOTE:git always work on nonlinier workflow 		
STEP5:
-----
REBASE:
---------
A=B=C=D=E=F
1st it will creat a batch of your source branch then u intigrate your new commit of your destination branch
git will compress the history of source branch into single patch 

NOTE:rebase always happened in child branch it will never happened in master branch 
=>source is master
=>destination is child ---every time it will happened in child or feature branch 

git rebase master=>source branch  

======================== 
tag
=========================
=>for relase spacific version we can tag it so that when we required we will get all info about that
=>a sorten point in you commit you mark it as rease or version
=>git tag --a v1.2 commit id -m "new version"
=>git tag
=>git show v1.2

==========================
stash => somthing you are saving for later use
      =>store safely in a hidden or secret place 
      =>git store your uncommited changes 
========================
=>modified some file 
=>git stash
=>all changes will stash
=>git stash list
=>git show stash@{0}
for single file 
=>git stash 
=>git stash pop stash@{0} =>remove the changes temp  to the working dir 
=>git stash apply =>we can apply the changes in other branch also(it should present both temp and working)
=>git stash drop  =>single file remove
=>git stash clear =>whole stash remove
----
git stash save "add style to our site"

====================
git fetch 
==================


pull conflit
=====================
add some file in git hub
add some file in local repo
do git pull

==================
git cherry-pick
===============
=>when user want to do a spacific commit then we can use cherry-pick
=>when u are doing merge that time all your commit is mergeing 
=>for single commit we can use cherry-pick
git cherry-pick commit id 
=>add some commit  in child branch
=>go to master and do git cherry-pick commit id 
 

====================
git fork
git clone
=====================
copy one github account repo to another git hub account 
copy the repo to your account 
click fork in right side of the github


cloneing will copy your repo to local repo /local machine
fork will copy one git hub account to another github account
=======================
pull request
======================
one github account to another github account /one branch to another ==>(one account)
----------------------------------------------
=>in dev2 azuredevops2021 =>create a file in github repo 
=>it is not avliable in dev1 mechine ashisnishanka=>github repo 
=>how can we push the file one github repo to another github repo
